2. Install Pygame (it's like magic but for games):
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Save the snake.py file somewhere you can find it (not in that folder where things go to die)
4. Run it:
   ```
   python snake.py
   ```
5. BOOM! Snake-tastic entertainment at your fingertips!

## üìù License

All rights reserved, all lefts too.

## üêõ Known Bugs

They're not bugs, they're FEATURES. Every weird thing the game does is 100% intentional and definitely not because we wrote this code while hyped up on energy drinks.
